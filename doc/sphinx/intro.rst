Intro to Cowbells
=================

The Cowbells package started as a green-field Geant4-based simulation
of the cosmic-ray test stand constructed for research and development
on water-based liquid scintilator at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
It was extended to handle the configuration used for beam tests at the
NASA Space Radiation Lab at BNL and then made general enough to
support any, with some small development, novel detector
configurations.
