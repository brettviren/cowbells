Cowbells simulation a simple but flexible Geant4-based detector simulation.

* Installation

** Prereq

Cmake, HepMC, Geant4, ROOT and a recent Python are needed.  

*** Grinst

The =grinst= project can be used to pre-build the necessary code:

  https://github.com/brettviren/grinst

Clone the repository and edit the =g4root.grinst= file to set the
target build and installation areas then do:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
./grinst.sh g4root.grinst install all
#+END_EXAMPLE

To setup the environment for building and running cowbells do

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
eval $(./grinst.sh cowbells.grinst setup all)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Build Cowbells

Cowbells is built with cmake.

It needs to be told where to find the major package dependencies.
This example assumes they have been built with =grinst= and the
environment has been setup as above.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cd /path/to/build_dir
cmake \
      -DHEPMC_DIR=$hepmc_install_dir \
      /path/to/source_dir
make 
#+END_EXAMPLE
