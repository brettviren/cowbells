Note for the Light Cone code usage:

0- very important: do not forget to set the adequate option for the the PMT QE.

1- the command ConstructLC setup the Winston cone: 
true to set the Winston cone, otherwise false.

2- the command ConstructWLSP setup the WLS Plates: 
true to set the WLS Plates, otherwise false.

3- the command ConstructWLS setup the WLS: 
true to set the WLS, otherwise false.

4- There is an additional primary particles generator to fill uniformly
the FV, to use it do the following:

i- /mygen/generator fill

ii-Set the type of the particles and its energy as usual with the commands
/gun/particle and /gun/energy

iii-There is a file "genfile.txt" containing the positions and the directions
of 1e5 particles, generated for the 100kton configuration. If more statistics 
are needed a biggest file might be generated in the same format. Make sure 
to have the right path to this file into the WCSimPrimaryGeneratorAction.cc.

Get a look at novisLC.mac, it is a typical file.mac example.

Update: 
1. Resolve the bug that one has to recompile the code to change the LC options
1.1 I have to move the material definition in WLSP to material construction
1.2 I also have to move the plate_size into WCSimConstructWC.cc ConstructWLSP

2. Add a few script into the analysis directory for plotting purpose

3. Validate the WLSP code with William

4. Validate the WLS film code. 

5. Go throug the code/ Check against old WCSim_WLS and WCSim_SVN
