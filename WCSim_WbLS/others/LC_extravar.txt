Description of the extra variables introduced into WCSimConstructWC.cc for 
winston cone purpose:

The configuration of the geometry in WCSim is based on the PMT radius, i.e.
the cell dimension, the pmt spacing...etc. John Felde made the geometry
setup, it is suitable to refer to his several presentations available 
on docdb about the subject. 
To insert the cones within the geometry, but at the same time
being able to not affect the coverage which depends on the pmt dimension
a new variable is introduced: WCPMTRadiusEff, this variable controls the 
dimension of the cell to let to accommodate the cones. There is also another 
variable: offset, the role of this variable is to adjust the cone on 
the pmt by avoiding any overlap between them.
There is also, the boolean variable "addLC", which is set through the
file.mac, it is used to set or not the winston cone.

The coordinates of the cones are taken with respect to those of the pmts, 
this is also the case for the symmetry operations.The logical and physical 
volumes of the cones are declared in similar way to the pmts's ones, as 
described in Geant4 manual.
